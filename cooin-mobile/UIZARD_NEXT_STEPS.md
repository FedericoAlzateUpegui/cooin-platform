- Container-Component pattern implemented
- Props interfaces clearly defined
- Placeholder components created with exact specs
- Integration guide with detailed requirements

## ðŸŽ¨ What You Need to Do in Uizard

### 1. Create These UI Components

Based on the detailed specifications in `UIZARD_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`, create these components in Uizard:

#### **Priority 1: Authentication Flow** (Start here)
1. **UizardWelcomeComponent** - App landing screen
2. **UizardLoginComponent** - User sign-in form
3. **UizardRegisterComponent** - User registration with role selection

#### **Priority 2: Core Features** (After auth is complete)
4. **UizardProfileSetupComponent** - Post-registration profile setup
5. **UizardDiscoveryComponent** - Main matching/discovery screen
6. **UizardConnectionsListComponent** - Connections management
7. **UizardChatComponent** - Messaging interface

### 2. Export Requirements

When you export from Uizard:
- **Format**: React Native components
- **Location**: Place in `src/components/uizard/`
- **Props**: Follow the exact prop interfaces defined in the integration guide
- **Components**: Use React Native components (View, Text, TouchableOpacity, etc.)

### 3. Integration Steps

1. **Replace placeholders** - Overwrite the placeholder files with your Uizard exports
2. **Test immediately** - Each component can be tested as soon as you create it
3. **Iterate quickly** - The container logic is complete, so you can focus purely on UI/UX

## ðŸ”¥ Why This Setup is Powerful

- **Instant Integration**: Your UI components will work immediately with zero additional coding
- **Complete Functionality**: All business logic, API calls, and state management is ready
- **Pure UI Focus**: You only need to worry about making beautiful, functional interfaces
- **Real Backend**: Test against actual API endpoints, not mocks

## ðŸ“± Test Your Components

As soon as you create each component:

1. **Replace the placeholder** with your Uizard component
2. **Run the app**: `npm start` then `npm run android` or `npm run ios`
3. **See it work**: Full functionality with your beautiful UI

## ðŸŽ¯ Component Priority Guide

Start with authentication components since they're the entry point to the app:

```
WelcomeComponent â†’ LoginComponent â†’ RegisterComponent â†’ ProfileSetupComponent
```

Each component has:
- âœ… Complete business logic ready
- âœ… Props interface defined
- âœ… Form validation implemented
- âœ… API integration complete
- âœ… Navigation handling ready

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. **Review** the detailed specifications in `UIZARD_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`
2. **Start with WelcomeComponent** - it's the simplest to begin with
3. **Create in Uizard** following the exact prop requirements
4. **Export and replace** the placeholder component
5. **Test immediately** - you'll see your UI working with real functionality!

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

- **Follow the props exactly** - they're designed to work perfectly with the containers
- **Use the Cooin design system** - colors and styles are defined in the guide
- **Test early and often** - each component works independently
- **Ask questions** - if anything is unclear about the props or requirements

**You're all set!** ðŸŽ‰ The foundation is complete and waiting for your beautiful Uizard designs to bring the Cooin app to life!
